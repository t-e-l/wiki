# TEL:Styling

_Comfortable styling customization_

TEL already includes a beautiful color sheme and patched icon font.

Use this plugin if you want to customize your styling via the long press menu.

TEL now provides the tel-theme command, which is preffered over the styling addon, however they are not mutually exclusive and a user can use both the styling addon and the (default provided) tel-theme command.
