# settings.conf

_TEL related settings_

The config file is located at `~/.tel/config/settings.conf`.

Following settings are supported:

`button-count`: how many app buttons the searchbar(sb) shows

`search-tolerance`: make it bigger to make searches more exact

`input-char`: the searchbar only works if this value is set to the first char that is displayed on the left in the input line. If you modify your shell config you need to modify this too

`default-buttons`: list of app names that are displayed at the sb if there is no input, separated by , 

`run-in-background`: [true/false] if TEL will run in the background permanently
